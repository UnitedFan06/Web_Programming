        <p align="justify" style="font-size:18px; font-family:'Times New Roman';">
            I am an avid <b>sports follower</b> showing an interest in various sports such as cricket, football, tennis, and many more. I am capable of watching any sport as long as I understand the rules of the game. I enjoy playing many video games and sports during my free time, and ensure that I stay <b>physically and mentally fit</b> by enjoying my free time by doing the same. Finally, I love watching movies and TV shows to relax my mind and have a couple of laughs from time to time during meal times. I also love <b>travelling and exploring</b> cuisines from around the globe and do so from time to time with my family.
